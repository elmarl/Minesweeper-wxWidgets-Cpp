Prerequisites:

wxWidgets for C++ (https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/).
CMake 3.6+. If you want to use an older CMake, remove the last line in the CMakeLists.txt which simply sets the project as the startup project. This can easily be done manually.

Build:

I used CMake 3.17.1 GUI, Visual Studio 2019 32bit. Older versions should also work.

Run:

If the main project "Minesweeper" is not already set as the startup project, right click and choose to make it so.

run project.
